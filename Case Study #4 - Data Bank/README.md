## Introduction 
Data Bank runs just like any other digital bank - but it isn‚Äôt only for banking activities, they also have the world‚Äôs most secure distributed data storage platform!

Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts. There are a few interesting caveats that go with this business model, and this is where the Data Bank team need your help!

The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need.

## Example Datasets
### Table 1: Regions

This `regions` table contains the `region_id` and their respective `region_name` values

| region_id | region_name |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1         | Africa      |
| 2         | America     |
| 3         | Asia        |
| 4         | Europe      |
| 5         | Oceania     |



### Table 2: Customer Nodes

Customers are randomly distributed across the nodes according to their region - this also specifies exactly which node contains both their cash and data.

This random distribution changes frequently to reduce the risk of hackers getting into Data Bank‚Äôs system and stealing customer‚Äôs money and data!

| customer_id | region_id   | node_id | start_date | end_date |
|-------------|------------|---------|----------|---------|
| 1           | 3 | 4       | 2020-01-02 | 2020-01-03|
| 2           | 3 | 5       | 2020-01-03 | 2020-01-17|
